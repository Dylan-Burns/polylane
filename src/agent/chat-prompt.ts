/**
 * Chat mode's system prompt (spec §9 "Chat mode" + Task 6.1) — assembled entirely server-side,
 * exactly like `prompts.ts`'s investigator prompt, and for the same reason: the client-held
 * conversation history is untrusted input (`api/chat.ts`'s `validateChatBody` strips it down to
 * plain user/assistant text turns before it ever reaches here), so this is the ONLY place the
 * model's role, scope, and tool access are ever defined. Nothing in a user message can add to,
 * remove from, or override anything in this file — that boundary is what makes prompt injection in
 * chat, the primary abuse surface on an unauthenticated URL, a data problem instead of a control
 * problem, and it's why the Security section below states the rule explicitly rather than relying
 * on the model to infer it.
 *
 * Same `renderTopology()` helper `prompts.ts` uses (imported, not hand-copied) — the persona
 * describes exactly the simulated world `sim/topology.ts` defines, never a second drifted copy of
 * it.
 *
 * **"Dig deeper" incident scoping** follows the same server-side-only rule: when a turn is opened
 * from a specific incident, the client sends nothing but that incident's ID — `api/chat.ts`
 * validates the id's shape, loads the incident and its investigation steps from D1 itself, and
 * renders them through `buildIncidentContext` into the `incidentContext` param here. The block
 * therefore contains only what the SERVER read from its own database, never client-supplied text,
 * and the client-held history stays exactly as untrusted as before; the appended section still
 * reiterates the data-not-instructions rule because the incident record embeds model-authored
 * report prose and raw log text, which deserve the same skepticism as any other observed data.
